# Neural Network

A feed-forward neural network implmentation built from scratch in Python.


## Project Goal

Build a fully functional neural network without using deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) to deeply understand the underlying mathematics and algorithms.


## Features (Planned)

- Pure Python and Numpy implementation
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation algorithm
- Multiple activation functions 
- Multiple loss functions 
- Stochastic gradient descent optimiser 
- MNIST digit classifier
